# SLAM @ HKU-MaRS
## Introduction to HKU-MaRS lab
Welcome to the Mechatronics and Robotic Systems (MaRS) Laboratory, located in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the prestigious University of Hong Kong (HKU). Our mission is to push the boundaries of mechatronic systems and robotics, by emphasizing practical applications that can improve human life and industry.

At MaRS Lab, our current research focuses on the design, planning, and control of aerial robots, as well as lidar-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We believe that these technologies can have a significant impact on many fields, from search and rescue operations to agriculture and beyond.

## Introduction to this repository
In this GitHub repository, we **present our latest research works related to SLAM**, organized chronologically by their ***publication date***. These works showcase our team's innovative ideas, rigorous methodologies, and cutting-edge solutions in the field of robotics. We hope that our work inspires you, and we welcome collaboration and feedback from the robotics community.
